<p>NetworkVisualizer is developed and maintained by <a href="https://sdproductions.github.io">SDProductions</a>.</p>
<p>NetworkVisualizer is a stable, secure, and scalable website built on the principle idea of cloud technology, headless operation, and managable infrastructure. The site operates using ASP.NET Core 2.1 MVC with an SQL database for information handling, all of which is hosted on Microsoft Azure. We ourselves do none of the packet sniffing - this is done on a separate utility on the target network. This site receives information through HttpPOST requests and has a layer of authentication to prevent unauthorized access. Our site automatically deletes information after 24 hours of recieving it, however, we state that information can remain on our servers for up to 30 days before deletion in case we would like to add increased analytical functionality. For more information on this, see our <a href="~/Privacy">Terms of Service</a>.</p>
