<h3>Config</h3>
<p>Config shows current site settings, which can be altered according to their descriptions. This can affect site functionality.</p>

<br />
<h3>Packets</h3>
<p>The packets page shows a list of every single packet in the database. You can manually delete packets.</p>

<br />
<h3>Audit</h3>
<p>The audit log shows every action that has been performed regarding site settings and the database.</p>

<br />
<h3>Account</h3>
<p>The account page shows the current signed in user. You can sign out of the account here. Accounts are according to the user signed in with their Azure Active Directory linked Microsoft account.</p>

<br />
<h3>Cache</h3>
<p>Cache can contain a variety of data but is primarily used to store JSON values of tables for the graphs shown on the front page. Whenever a user loads the front page, a single database call is made to Cache, shortening load times and improving site performance.</p>
<p>In the event that you want to manually upload a graph, revert to a previous graph, or edit other cache values, you can do so through this page. Since the JSON format used by the main graphs is difficult to understand, we do not recommend touching this if you don't know what you are doing.</p>
